title: Database Setup

This library has been developed so that you can use any type of backend storage; relational, document, key value,
columnar or even hardcoded.

The documentation for each of the repository interfaces describes what sort of data you might want to store not how
to store it.

> Please apply your own database implementation in [repository](repositories) classes.
